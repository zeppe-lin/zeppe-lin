  KVM

    If you don't have kvm compiled into the kernel, make sure you have the
    kernel module loaded before running kvm.  The easiest way to ensure that
    the kernel module is loaded is to load it on boot.  For AMD CPUs the
    module is called 'kvm-amd'.  For Intel CPUs the module is called
    'kvm-intel'.  Please review /etc/rc.modules for how to load these.

    Make sure your user is in the 'kvm' group.  Just run
      $ gpasswd -a <USER> kvm
    then have <USER> re-login.

    For brand new installs, the default permissions on /dev/kvm might not let
    you access it.  You can tell udev to reset ownership/perms:
      $ udevadm trigger -c add /dev/kvm
