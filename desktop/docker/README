  NON-ROOT USER

    To use docker as a non-root user, add the user to the 'docker'
    group:

      $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER


  KERNEL CONFIGURATION

    Docker requires quite a few kernel options to be enabled.  To see
    a list and check your kernel for compatibility, run
    /usr/share/docker/check-config.sh.
