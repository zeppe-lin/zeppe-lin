.SH DESCRIPTION
.B st
is a simple terminal emulator.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
disable alternate screens in terminal
.TP
.BI \-c " class"
defines the window class (default $TERM).
.TP
.BI \-f " font"
defines the
.I font
to use when st is run.
.TP
.BI \-g " geometry"
defines the X11 geometry string.
The form is [=][<cols>{xX}<rows>][{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>]. See
.BR XParseGeometry (3)
for further details.
.TP
.B \-i
will fixate the position given with the -g option.
.TP
.BI \-n " name"
defines the window instance name (default $TERM).
.TP
.BI \-o " iofile"
writes all the I/O to
.I iofile.
This feature is useful when recording st sessions. A value of "-" means
standard output.
.TP
.BI \-T " title"
defines the window title (default 'st').
.TP
.BI \-t " title"
defines the window title (default 'st').
.TP
.BI \-w " windowid"
embeds st within the window identified by
.I windowid
.TP
.BI \-l " line"
use a tty
.I line
instead of a pseudo terminal.
.I line
should be a (pseudo-)serial device (e.g. /dev/ttyS0 on Linux for serial port
0).
When this flag is given
remaining arguments are used as flags for
.BR stty(1).
By default st initializes the serial line to 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
and a 38400 baud rate. The speed is set by appending it as last argument
(e.g. 'st -l /dev/ttyS0 115200'). Arguments before the last one are
.BR stty(1)
flags. If you want to set odd parity on 115200 baud use for example 'st -l
/dev/ttyS0 parenb parodd 115200'. Set the number of bits by using for
example 'st -l /dev/ttyS0 cs7 115200'. See
.BR stty(1)
for more arguments and cases.
.TP
.B \-v
prints version information to stderr, then exits.
.TP
.BI \-e " command " [ " arguments " "... ]"
st executes
.I command
instead of the shell.  If this is used it
.B must be the last option
on the command line, as in xterm / rxvt.
This option is only intended for compatibility,
and all the remaining arguments are used as a command
even without it.
.SH SHORTCUTS
.TP
.B Break
Send a break in the serial line.
Break key is obtained in PC keyboards
pressing at the same time control and pause.
.TP
.B Ctrl-Print Screen
Toggle if st should print to the
.I iofile.
.TP
.B Shift-Print Screen
Print the full screen to the
.I iofile.
.TP
.B Print Screen
Print the selection to the
.I iofile.
.TP
.B Ctrl-Shift-Page Up
Increase font size.
.TP
.B Ctrl-Shift-Page Down
Decrease font size.
.TP
.B Ctrl-Shift-Home
Reset to default font size.

Copy the selected text to the clipboard selection.
.TP
.B Ctrl-Shift-v
Paste from the clipboard selection.
.SH VIM BROWSE
The vim-browse patch offers the possibility to move through the terminal
history-buffer, search for strings and use VIM-like motions, operations
and quantifiers.
.br
It operates on top of the history-patch, which comes with a set of optional
features that can be compiled-in as separate patches. It is possible to move
through terminal history while an application currently writes to the terminal
buffer and comes with an overlay highlighting the current search results on
screen and showing current operation / motions / search string.
.SS Customization
The following variables can be adapted from the defaults defined in
\fIconfig.def.h\fR:
.TP
.B buffSize
Size of the buffer history in lines.
.TP
.B highlightBg, highlightFg
Background / Foreground color of search results.
.TP
.B currentBg
Background color used in order to highlight the current history cursor via a
cross.
.TP
.B nmKeys
Custom commands (= sequence of operations/motion), the first character is the
key to be used in order to execute the sequence of operations / motions.
.TP
.B styleSearch
Style of the search string overlay.
.TP
.B style
Styles of the command string overlay depending on the currently active
operation ([yank, visual, visualLine, no operation]).

can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
