ABOUT libffi

    This package implements a portable, high level programming
    interface to various calling conventions.  Some programs may not
    know at the time of compilation what arguments are to be passed to
    a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be told at run-time
    about the number and types of arguments used to call a given
    function.  Libffi can be used in such programs to provide a bridge
    from the interpreter program to compiled code.
