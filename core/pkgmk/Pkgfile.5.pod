=head1 NAME

Pkgfile - build file for pkgmk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<Pkgfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page describes the format of the F<Pkgfile> file.  The
file is a L<sh(1)|https://www.mankier.com/1/sh> script, which defines
a number of variables (I<name>, I<version>, I<release> and I<source>)
and a function (I<build>) that should be executed in order to compile
a package.

=head2 General guidelines

The name of a package should always be lowercase (e.g. B<name=eterm>
and not B<name=Eterm>.  Dashes are also allowed.

In case the package is added to the packages sources tree the exact
same name should be used for the name of the directory in the packages
sources structure, i.e. I</usr/src/zeppe-lin/???/eterm>.

Do not combine several separately distributed programs/libraries into
one package.  Make several packages instead.

=head2 Directories

In general packages should install files in these directories.
Exceptions are of course allowed if there is a good reason.  But try
to follow the following directory structure as close as possible.

=begin man

.TS
center, box, line, tab (|) ;
l                  | l
l                  | l.

/usr/lib/          | Libraries
/usr/include/      | Header files

    Directory          | Description
    -------------------|------------------------------------------------------
    /usr/bin/          | User command/application binaries
    /usr/sbin/         | System binaries (e.g. daemons)

=end text

I</opt> directory is reserved for manually compiled/installed
applications, or binary distributable packages.  Good packages (built
from sources) should never place anything there.

I</usr/libexec/> is not used, thus packages should never install
anything there.  Use I</usr/lib/E<lt>progE<gt>/> instead.

=head2 Junk files

Packages should not contain "junk files".  This includes info pages
and other online documentation, man pages excluded (e.g.
I</usr/doc/*>, I<README>, I<*.info>, I<*.html>, etc).

Also should be removed:

=over

=item *

Files related to NLS (national language support), always use
B<--disable-nls> when available and remove I</usr/share/locale/*> when
not.

=item *

Useless or obsolete binaries (e.g. F</usr/games/banner> and
F</sbin/mkfs.minix>).

=back

=head2 Variable names

Do not add new variables to the F<Pkgfile>.  Only in very few cases
does this actually improve the readability or the quality of the
package.  Further, the only variables that are guaranteed to work with
future versions of
L<pkgmk(8)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/pkgmk/pkgmk.8.pod>
are I<name>, I<version>, I<release> and I<source>.  Other names could
be in conflict with internal variables in
L<pkgmk(8)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/pkgmk/pkgmk.8.pod>.

Use the I<$name> and I<$version> variables to make the package easier
to update/maintain.  For example,

  source=http://xyz.org/$name-$version.tar.gz

is better than

  source=http://xyz.org/prog-1.0.3.tar.gz

since the URL will automatically updated when you modify the
I<$version> variable.

Note that I<source> variable is a string, where each item is separated
by a whitespace.  If you want to specify multiple files, use quotes:

  source="http://xyz.org/$name-$version.tar.gz
          http://xyz.org/$name-$version.patch"

=head2 Header

Provide a header including the following fields:

=begin man

.TS
center, box, line, tab (|) ;
l            | l
l            | l.
Name         | Meaning
_
.SP
Description  | A short description of the package (keep it factual)
Maintainer   | Your full name and e-mail address, obfuscated if you want
URL          | A webpage with more information on this software package
Depends on   | A list of dependencies, separated either by spaces
.TE

=end man

=begin html

 <table>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:left;">Name</th>
   <th style="text-align:left;">Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Description</td>
   <td>A short description of the package (keep it factual)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Maintainer</td>
   <td>Your full name and e-mail address, obfuscated if you want</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>URL</td>
   <td>A webpage with more information on this software package</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Depends on</td>
   <td>A list of dependencies, separated either by spaces</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

=end html

=begin text

    Name         | Meaning
    -------------|----------------------------------------------------------
    Description  | A short description of the package (keep it factual)
    Maintainer   | Your full name and e-mail address, obfuscated if you want
    URL          | A webpage with more information on this software package
    Depends on   | A list of dependencies, separated either by spaces
    
=end text

I<Depends on> can be omitted if there are no dependencies.

=head2 Dependencies

Dependencies are supported by
L<pkgman(1)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/pkgman/pkgman.1.pod>.
The following rules should be respected:

=over

=item *

We list all linked runtime dependencies except for gcc (libstdc++),
glibc, binutils and the package itself (to prevent cyclic dependencies).

=item *

B<core> contains essential packages for a system, and our scripts and
source packages expect the programs provided by B<core> to be installed.
This means that:

=over

=item *

Build dependencies provided by core are not listed in the dependency
header.

=item *

Runtime dependencies from B<core> which aren't dynamically linked in
are not to be listed I<with one exception>: if the package provides a
library for Perl/Python and contains a specific interpreter version in
its F<.footprint>.

=back

=back

Examples:

=over

=item F<core/automake>

Does B<not> list perl, because the program is a perl script (there is
no binary that links to libperl).

=item F<core/bc>

B<Does> list readline, because bc is linked to readline.

=item F<core/python3-setuptools>

B<Does> list python3, because the package contains the specific
interpreter version in its F<.footprint>.

=back

The reasoning for this policy is that you can use
L<revdep(1)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/revdep/revdep.1.pod>
to find packages that need to be updated if one of the dependent
libraries has become binary incompatible.  To find out what libraries
a binary is linked to, use L<ldd(1)|https://www.mankier.com/1/ldd> or
L<finddeps(1)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/system/pkgmaint/finddeps.1.pod>.

Also, in the case of updating the major version of Perl/Python, it
will be useful that the libraries or programs that create Perl/Python
bindings have a dependency on them.  We will have to rebuild
everything that depends on Perl/Python with one command (see
L<pkgman-rdep(1)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/pkgman/pkgman-rdep.1.pod>).

=head2 The rc.d scripts

The actual scripts that control services should be named
C<< rc.<prog> >>, and installed to F<< /etc/rc.d/<prog> >>.

See L<EXAMPLES/"rc.d script"> for template script for a package.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The I<build> function should use the C<$SRC> variable whenever it
needs to access the files listed in the C<source> variable, and the
C<$PKG> variable as the root destination of the output files.

Being a shell script executed in the context of
L<pkgmk(8)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/pkgmk/pkgmk.8.pod>,
the entire F<Pkgfile> file has access to the variables initialized
in F<pkgmk.conf> and the default values set by
L<pkgmk(8)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/pkgmk/pkgmk.8.pod>.
Also, as an undocumented side effect of how it is used by
L<pkgmk(8)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/pkgmk/pkgmk.8.pod>,
it can also change the behaviour of
L<pkgmk(8)|https://github.com/zeppe-lin/zeppe-lin/blob/master/core/pkgmk/pkgmk.8.pod>
by rewriting some of its functions and variables while the current
package is built.  However, the I<build> function has only read access
to these mentioned above.

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

Most of the command failures in I<build> function will stop the build
process.  There is no need to explicitly check the return codes.  If
you need/want to handle a command failure you should use constructs
like:

  if ! command ... ; then ... ; fi

  command || ...
