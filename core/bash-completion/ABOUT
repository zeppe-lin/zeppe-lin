ABOUT bash-completion

  bash completion extends bash's standard completion behavior to achieve
  complex command lines with just a few keystrokes. This project was conceived
  to produce programmable completion routines for the most common Linux/UNIX
  commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins and programmers need to do
  on a daily basis.
