if package is already built with .footprint mismatch,
pkgman will install it.

Is it good?

- add --rebuild-set to dependent
- allow dependency injection for sysup, with previews
- prefer toolchain (patch in trac)
- logging: check for non-root owned symlinks
- logging: reject relative logfile names
- parallel build and download
- download command
- rewrite arg parser

CONSIDER:

- default formats for printf and dup
- add update-footprint, update-md5sum commands (patch in trac)
- sysup
  - allow injecting of new (uninstalled) dependencies
  - allow to prohibit recompilation of packages when a dependency failed
    to be updated in this sysup run
- big command consolidation

  prt-get dep|depends [--tree|-T] [--recursive|-R] [--quick|-Q]
    so
    depends -> dep
    current depends -> dep -R
    quickdep -> dep -Q
    deptree -> dep -T

  Similar for other commands


OLD NOTES:

- --quiet mode; suppress output of pkgmk and pkgadd
- prt-get diff stats: "100 Packages with differences"
- Make InstallTransaction a real install transaction:
  - rollback pre-install if package building failed
  - needs heavy refactoring to be easier to understand/maintain
- Test mode: global (is duplicated right now)
- remove should be in a transaction as well
  - remove transaction
  - install transaction
  - etc.
  - Transaction handler
- better examples for man page
- reorder message to avoid losing the important bits when installing
    _lots_ of packages; maybe also think about forgeting not so
    important things like packages installed before etc

- interrupt handler (ctrl-c) kill pkgmk/pkgadd, delete lock files, say
    "prt-get: action cancelled"; warn when cancel during download ->
    STATE variable, separate download and build.
- move command name out of execTransaction (would be wrong for e.g.
    sysup)

- symbolic exit codes

* questions:
  - should there be a install/update mixed to mode, to install and update,
    which ever method is needed?
  - namespace prtget ? 
  - remove the path:package1, package2 filter functionality from the
    config file again. This could be done by creating another ports
    directories an creation symlinks there to. Could improve performance
  - might people like ansi colors?
