script that defines font, timezone, hostname and services which are
used on system initialization and shutdown.

The file consists of a number of variable assignments of the form

symbol as the first character on the line.

The different configuration variables are:

=over 8

=item B<FONT>="I<STRING>"

Example: C<FONT=default>

=item B<KEYMAP>="I<STRING>"
