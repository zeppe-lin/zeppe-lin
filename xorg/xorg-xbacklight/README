    -- FIX "No outputs have backlight property"

    If you get the "No outputs have backlight property" error, it is
    because xrandr/xbacklight does not choose the right directory in
    /sys/class/backlight.  You can specify the directory by setting
    the "Backlight" option of the device section in
    /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-video.conf.

    For instance, if the name of the directory is intel_backlight and
    using the Intel driver, the device section may be configured as
    follows:

        $ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-video.conf

        Section "Device"
          Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
          Driver      "intel"
          Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
        EndSection

End of file.
