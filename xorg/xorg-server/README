README xorg-server


  WARNING

    If you fail to rebuild input and video packages for xorg-server on
    major ABI changes, eg. 1.16.0 -> 1.17.0.  You will end up with no
    mouse or keyboard and possibly no direct 3D acceleration for video.

    If you do happen to forget and have sys-rq enabled in your kernel
    you can do a safe reboot with holding down Alt + SysRq, and typing
    the following sequence in order, pausing for several seconds between
    each key:

        reisub


  POST-INSTALL

    After upgrading xorg-server, from major versions rebuild video and
    input packages:

    NOTE: This only applies on ABI changes between major versions
    e.g, 1.16.0 -> 1.17.0.

        # pkgman update -fr $(pkgman list --regex \
              --filter='^xorg-xf86-(input|video)|^mesa')

    If you use nvidia you also need to do this:

        # gl-select use xorg && gl-select use nvidia
