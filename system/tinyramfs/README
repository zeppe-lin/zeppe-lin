  INITRAMFS WITH ENCRYPTED ROOT

    1. Install cryptsetup (of course).

    2. In manual kernel setup is recommended to include the following
       necessary features (statically or as modules).

    General Setup --->
      [*] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (iniramfs/initrd) support

    Device Drivers --->
      Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM) --->
        [*] Device mapper support
        [*] Crypt target support

    Cryptographic API --->
      <*> XTS support
      <*> SHA224 and SHA256 digest algorithm
      <*> AES cipher algorithms
      <*> AES cipher algorithms (x86_64)
      <*> User-space interface for hash algorithms
      <*> User-space interface for symmetric key cipher algorithms

    3. Read the tinyramfs' manual pages to see the various
       configuration settings:
