  POST-INSTALL

    Once the grub2 package is installed, the boot loader itself can be
    installed like so:

    # grub-install /dev/<device>

    For example, to install grub2 into the master boot record of the
    first SCSI or SATA drive:

    # grub-install /dev/sda

    To install to the second partition of the first SCSI or SATA drive
    instead of the MBR:

    # grub-install /dev/sda2

    A configuration menu file is required for grub2 to do more than
    display a command line. It can be created automatically using the
    'grub-mkconfig' command like so:

    # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

    The file /etc/default/grub controls the operation of grub-mkconfig.
    The typical usage is:

    GRUB_TIMEOUT=3 GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=CRUX
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet resume=/dev/mapper/swap"

    See
    https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/Simple-configuration.html
    for more information.

    For grub-mkconfig to work properly the following conditions should
    be met:

    1) The kernel is expected to be named one of these ways:
       /boot/vmlinuz-* /vmlinuz-* /boot/kernel-*

       If the kernel is located somewhere else grub-mkconfig will
       NOT find it! For example, '/boot/vmlinuz-3.10.28' is good and
       '/boot/linux-3.10.28' would not be found.

    2) When dual-booting with Linux installations on other partitions
       or drives, grub-mkconfig will not find them without the extra
       program 'os-prober' installed.

    The configuration file can also be created manually. A sample
    grub.cfg is included in the package source:

    $ pkgman cat grub2 grub.cfg.sample


End of file.
