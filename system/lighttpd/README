README lighttpd


  POST-INSTALL

    lighttpd runs as a different user ('lighttpd') by default for
    security reasons. Do the following after installing the package:

    # useradd -s /bin/false lighttpd
    # groupadd lighttpd
    # touch /var/www/logs/access_log
    # touch /var/www/logs/error_log
    # chown lighttpd:lighttpd /var/www/logs/*

    If you wish to enable SSL support, uncomment the relevant lines in 
    /etc/lighttpd.conf and generate a self-signed certificate:

    # openssl req -new -x509 \
      -keyout /etc/ssl/certs/lighttpd.pem \
      -out    /etc/ssl/certs/lighttpd.pem \
      -days 365 -nodes


  PRECAUTION

    As of lighttpd 1.4.23 spawn-fcgi was removed and is now provided as
    a separate project at http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/spawn-fcgi


End of file.
