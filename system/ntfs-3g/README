    KERNEL CONFIGURATION

    Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and
    recompile the kernel if necessary:

        File systems  --->
        <*/M> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support [CONFIG_FUSE_FS]


    USER MOUNT

    If you want ordinary users to be able to mount NTFS partitions
    you'll need to set mount.ntfs with the root user ID.

    Note: it is probably unsafe to do this on a computer that needs
    to be secure !

        # chmod -v 4755 /sbin/mount.ntfs

End of file.
