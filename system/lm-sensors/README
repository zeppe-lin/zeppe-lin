    KERNEL CONFIGURATION

  - Enable "I2C support" (CONFIG_I2C=y or m).  On many motherboards,
    the sensor chip is connected to the SMBus, which is supported by
    I2C in the Linux kernel.

  - Enable "I2C device interface" (CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV=m).
    sensors-detect needs this to probe for SMBus hardware monitoring
    chips.

  - In "I2C Hardware Bus support", enable all drivers you might need,
    preferably as modules. If you're not sure, select them all.

  - Enable "Hardware Monitoring support" (CONFIG_HWMON=y or m).

  - Enable all hardware monitoring drivers you might need, preferably
    as modules.
