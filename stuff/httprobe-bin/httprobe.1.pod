=head1 httprobe

Take a list of domains and probe for working http and https servers.

=head1 Basic Usage

httprobe accepts line-delimited domains on stdin:

  $ cat recon/example/domains.txt
  example.com
  example.edu
  example.net
  $ cat recon/example/domains.txt | httprobe
  http://example.com
  http://example.net
  http://example.edu
  https://example.com
  https://example.edu
  https://example.net

=head1 Extra Probes

By default httprobe checks for HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443. You can add additional probes with the -p flag by specifying a protocol and port pair:

  $ cat domains.txt | httprobe -p http:81 -p https:8443

=head1 Concurrency

You can set the concurrency level with the -c flag:

  $ cat domains.txt | httprobe -c 50

=head1 Timeout

You can change the timeout by using the -t flag and specifying a timeout in milliseconds:

  $ cat domains.txt | httprobe -t 20000

=head1 Skipping Default Probes

If you don't want to probe for HTTP on port 80 or HTTPS on port 443, you can use the -s flag. You'll need to specify the probes you do want using the -p flag:

  $ cat domains.txt | httprobe -s -p https:8443

=head1 Prefer HTTPS

Sometimes you don't care about checking HTTP if HTTPS is working. You can do that with the --prefer-https flag:

  $ cat domains.txt | httprobe --prefer-https
